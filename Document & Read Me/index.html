		<h3 id="intro"><strong>A) Introduction</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
        <p> <strong> What's app </strong> ,  A very familiar chat engine code is cloned here with  robust server side technology socket.io ,Nodejs and MongoDB as database and with same architure as followed by Original Whats app  . <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This code is no where found any where on market with this robust architure and is only available to CODE CAYNON users at very good price.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also this code is tested on iOS & Andriod platform. (This supports window’s as well but we have not tested on any window’s device yet.)  
        <br>
        The app uses SASS, which is CSS with super powers. Each component has its own sass files and partials well structured with independent variables to get maximum modularity, flexibility and customizability.
